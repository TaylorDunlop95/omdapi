# Omdapi

## Using the App.

When using Omdapi, you have limited access to the [oMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) movie database.

You are able to preform two kinds of searches. One grabs all movies across time based on the title searched and the other grabs one movie based on the title and year.

This is intended to be a basic demonstration on api interaction with an Angular application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

To obtain coverage results, run `ng test --watch=false --code-coverage`
This will generate a coverage report from the existing tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
